        <h1 id="days-of-code-1-pokedex">Days of Code #1 Pokedex</h1>
<p>During the days of code challange I will try to finish one coding project in just one day. Probably none of them will be perfect and truth to be told few of them will be remotely as
good as I expected them to be. But point of this challange that I set onto myself is not to produce perfect, flawless code that will bring me money, power and women (although I would&#39;nt mind if it did).
The purpose of this challange is CONSISTENCY. I&#39;m a master procrastinator. Although I tell myself I like coding and I like starting to watch Udemy or Youtube coding videos, I rarely actually start writing the code.
And even on more rare occasions I actually finish something the way I wanted or indented it to end up looking. </p>
<p>I&#39;m not gonna start &quot;X number of days of code&quot; challange as many other developers have done before me, because I know I&#39;m not gonna reach that number of days no matter what (sic).
I&#39;m just gonna open up code editor every day, starting today, and try to finish even just the simplest project. From start to finish.
In order to make it more harder for myself I will write readme for every project that explains how I built it, what I learned and what I didnt understand and why I failed miserably.</p>
<h2 id="wtf-is-this-">WTF is this?</h2>
<p>My first project is a Pokemon website that fetches first 150 Pokemons from <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">PokeAPI</a>. I came up with it thanks to
watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-VQUKeSU1w">Quicks</a> Youtube video. The website doesn&#39;t do anything more than just display 150 pokemons.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-used-">What was used?</h2>
<ul>
<li>ES6 fancy fetch methods, promises and all that async mumbo-jumbo used to fetch data using API&#39;s</li>
<li>HTML and CSS (SCSS of course) for building the website</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>About the existance of PokeAPI</li>
<li>New way of making fetch requests</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-i-didn-t-understand">What I didn&#39;t understand</h2>
<ul>
<li>Promise all</li>
<li>JS Maps</li>
<li>How the f did it actually fetched the neccessary data</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-can-it-be-improved">How can it be improved</h2>
<ul>
<li>Better UI</li>
<li>Search </li>
<li>Fetch on scroll</li>
<li>Realized in some SPA</li>
<li>Display more data about selected Pokemon and show it in an interesting way</li>
</ul>
